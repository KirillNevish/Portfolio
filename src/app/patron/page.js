                <p className=" fs-5">In the storied chronicles of the Empire of Donetsk, where great heroes and valiant deeds are immortalized, one humble yet extraordinary figure stands out: Dog Patron. His tale, interwoven with the legends of Emperor Penis Dushilin and Commander Guts, is one of loyalty, courage, and sacrifice.</p>

                <div className="container fs-4 text-black text-decoration-underline">The Discovery of Patron</div>
                <p className=" fs-5">The story begins in 1679, a time of relative peace and prosperity under the wise rule of Emperor Penis Dushilin. One day, while walking through the bustling downtown of the empire, Dushilin came upon a pitiful sight. A small, skinny, and weak dog lay in the shadows of an alley, barely clinging to life. Despite his regal status, Dushilin’s heart was moved by the plight of this helpless creature. With great compassion, he ordered that the dog be brought to his temple.

                    In the sanctuary of the emperor's temple, the dog received the best care possible. He was given nourishing food, healing medicines, and a safe place to rest. Under this tender care, the dog regained his strength. His once dull eyes sparkled with life, and his emaciated frame filled out with health and vitality. Grateful and loyal, the dog was named Patron, a tribute to the emperor’s benevolence.</p>

                <div className="container fs-4 text-black text-decoration-underline">Patron Joins Guts' Squad</div>
                <p className=" fs-5">Recognizing Patron’s potential and spirit, Emperor Dushilin decided that the dog’s newfound strength could serve the empire. He sent Patron to join the squad of the legendary warrior, Commander Guts. Guts, known for his unmatched prowess and bravery, was initially skeptical of the small, seemingly fragile dog. However, Patron soon proved his worth.

                    Patron's keen senses and agility made him an invaluable asset to Guts' squad, particularly in the dangerous task of mine-clearing. For two centuries, Patron faithfully served alongside Guts, becoming a beloved and essential member of the team. His ability to detect hidden dangers saved countless lives, and his bravery in the face of peril earned him the respect of even the most hardened warriors.</p>

                <div className="container fs-4 text-black text-decoration-underline">The Tragic Day in Luhansk</div>
                <p className=" fs-5">In 1938, during a campaign across the conquered lands of Luhansk, a tragic event unfolded that would forever etch Patron’s name in the annals of Donetsk history. The squad, tasked with clearing a path through a heavily mined area, relied on Patron’s expertise. The faithful dog, ever diligent and courageous, led the way, his nose and instincts finely tuned to detect the deadly traps laid by the enemy.

                    However, fate dealt a cruel blow that day. An especially well-hidden mine escaped detection until it was too late. Patron, ever fearless, was caught in the explosion. The blast reverberated through the land, a grim testament to the dangers that still lurked in the shadows. Patron's sacrifice was immediate and heartbreaking, his small body giving its all to protect those he had served so loyally.</p>

                <div className="container fs-4 text-black text-decoration-underline">A Nation in Mourning</div>
                <p className=" fs-5">The death of Dog Patron sent ripples of sorrow throughout the Empire of Donetsk. The people, who had grown to love and admire the brave little dog, were plunged into mourning. For a week, the entire empire grieved the loss of their faithful companion. Stories of Patron’s heroism and loyalty were shared far and wide, and his love for candies, a small but endearing detail of his life, became a symbol of his innocent joy and steadfast spirit.

                    Emperor Dushilin, now in the twilight of his reign, honored Patron’s memory with a grand ceremony. A monument was erected in the capital city, depicting Patron in all his noble glory. The inscription read: “To Dog Patron, the Brave and Loyal, Who Gave His Life for the Empire.”</p>
